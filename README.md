Copy of v0.5.5, r7119. http://sourceforge.net/p/retroshare/code/HEAD/tree/branches/
Commits in this repo have added support for:
* get(keypair) and set(keypair) commands to BitDHT (RetroShare's DHT library).
* a functioning prototype for username/password based decentralised authentication which abstracts the PGP key away from the user instead allowing them to login with a username/password, from any device.
